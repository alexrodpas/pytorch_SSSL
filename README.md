# pytorch_SSSL
A PyTorch implementation of the Semi-Supervised Shapelet Learning (SSSL) algorithm, defined in the research paper "Time series feature learning with labeled and unlabeled data", Haishuai Wang, Qin Zhang, Jia Wu, Shirui Pan, Yixin Chen, Pattern Recognition, Volume 89, 2019, Pages 55-66.

## Introduction
SSSL efficiently learns shapelets by using both labeled and unlabeled time series data. Briefly, SSSL engages both labeled and unlabeled time series data in an integrated model that considers the least squares regression, the power of the pseudo-labels, shapelets regularization, and spectral analysis.
